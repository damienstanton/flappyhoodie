### flappy hoodie

This is a toy example of a Flappy Birds clone using the `sdl` Go binding to build the UI. It is based on Francesc Campoy's [JustForFunc video #6: Flappy Gopher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYkxFbd6luY).

Instead of Francesc's friendly bird, I quickly drew/captured a terrifying flying version of my own head in a blue hoodie.
